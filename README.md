## Tech

Book-Buddy uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [RubyonRails] - Ruby on Rails scales from HELLO WORLD to IPO.
- [Postgresql] - PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database.
- [Stimulus] - A modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have.
- [Cloudinary] - Media Experience Cloud.
- [Bootstrat] - Powerful, extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build and customize with Sass.
- [Flatpickr] - A lightweight and powerful datetime picker.
- [Webpack] - Bundle your life.
- [Many More!]

And of course Book-Buddy itself is open source with [Book-Buddy]
 on GitHub [git-repo-url].
